                                          of the log directory on the broker. 
                                          If absolute log directory path is   
                                          specified, the replica will be moved
                                          to the specified log directory on   
                                          the broker.

                                          (bytes/sec). Rerunning with this    
                                          option, whilst a rebalance is in    
                                          progress, will alter the throttle   
                                          value. The throttle rate should be  
                                          at least 1 KB/s. (default: -1)      
--throttle &lt;Long: throttle&gt;             The movement of partitions between    
                                          brokers will be throttled to this   
                                          value (bytes/sec). Rerunning with

                                          in progress, will alter the throttle
                                          value. The throttle rate should be  
                                          at least 1 KB/s. (default: -1)      
--timeout &lt;Long: timeout&gt;               The maximum time in ms allowed to wait
                                          for partition reassignment execution

                                          specified, and the rebalance has    
                                          completed, the throttle will be     
                                          removed

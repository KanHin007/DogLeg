--resource-pattern-type                  The type of the resource pattern or

--resource-pattern-type                  The type of the resource pattern or    
  <ANY|MATCH|LITERAL|PREFIXED>             pattern filter. When adding acls,    
                                           this should be a specific pattern    
                                           type, e.g. 'literal' or 'prefixed'.  
                                           When listing or removing acls, a     
                                           specific pattern type can be used to 
                                           list or remove acls from specific    
                                           resource patterns, or use the filter 
                                           values of 'any' or 'match', where    
                                           'any' will match any pattern type,   
                                           but will match the resource name     
                                           exactly, where as 'match' will       
                                           perform pattern matching to list or  
                                           remove all acls that affect the      
                                           supplied resource(s). WARNING:       
                                           'match', when used in combination    
                                           with the '--remove' switch, should   
                                           be used with care. (default: LITERAL)
--topic <String: topic>                  topic to which ACLs should be added or 
                                           removed. A value of * indicates ACL  
                                           should apply to all topics.

  transactional-id>                        should be added or removed. A value  
                                           of * indicates the ACLs should apply 
                                           to all transactionalIds.
